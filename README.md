# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides a grid-based game board where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can without colliding.

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the on-screen buttons to control the snake's direction.
3. Guide the snake to eat the food represented by red squares on the game board.
4. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
5. Avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
6. When the game ends, an alert message will be displayed with your final score.
7. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
